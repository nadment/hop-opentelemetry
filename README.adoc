# Hop OpenTelemetry Plugin

## Overview

This plugin exports distributed telemetry data for analysis, currently sending traces to monitor the execution of workflows/actions/pipelines.

It uses https://opentelemetry.io[OpenTelemetry], an open source observability framework for generating, processing and transmitting telemetry data in a single, unified format. 

OpenTelemetry Metrics and Logging are not yet correctly supported.

## How to install

### System Requirements

https://hop.apache.org[Apache Hop] 2.7 or above.

### Manual Install

1. Unzip the plugin archive into the hop\plugins\ directory
2. Configure OpenTelemetry manually by setting the system variables below or using the GUI perspective configuration tab.
		- OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: Specify logical service name.
		- OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: Specify target URL of the OpenTelemetry Collector to which send data.
		- OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: Key-value pairs to be used as headers associated with requests. The format is a list of key-value pairs separated by the "=" character  (i.e.: key1=value1,key2=value2)
		- OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT: Default timeout is 10 seconds
3. Restart Hop
